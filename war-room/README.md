# AI-ULU War Room Dashboard

TOP SECRET: This dashboard is public by design. Do not publish any private repo data,
secrets, internal hostnames, or sensitive metrics. Only public-safe metrics should
land in war-room/data/*.json.

## Overview

The **War Room Dashboard** is a real-time monitoring interface that visualizes the autonomous operations of the entire ai-ulu ecosystem. Built with a Matrix-inspired cyberpunk aesthetic, it provides instant visibility into:

- **Autonomous Operation Rate (AOR)** - % of operations running without human intervention
- **Resilience Stability Index (RSI)** - System reliability and self-healing capability
- **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)** - Average time for autonomous issue resolution
- **Live Agent Activity** - Real-time feed of autonomous agent operations
- **Repository Health Matrix** - Visual grid of all repositories with Aura scores
- **Chaos Engineering Stats** - Results from resilience testing

---

## Features

### Visual Design
- **Matrix Rain Background** - Animated falling characters effect
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic** - Neon colors (cyan, purple, green) with glows and gradients
- **Responsive Layout** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Smooth Animations** - Micro-interactions and transitions throughout

### Real-Time Data
- **Auto-Refresh** - Metrics update every 15 seconds
- **GitHub API Integration** - Live data from organization repositories
- **Fallback Data** - Graceful degradation if API is unavailable
- **Smart Caching** - Optimized performance with minimal API calls

### Autonomous Updates
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated deployment every 15 minutes
- **Metric Calculation** - AOR, RSI, MTTR computed from real repository data
- **Agent Activity Tracking** - Monitors commits, PRs, and issues for agent signatures
- **Repository Scoring** - Dynamic Aura calculation based on activity and health

## Deployment

### Automated (Recommended)

The dashboard deploys automatically via GitHub Actions:

1. **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch, scheduled every 15 minutes, or manual dispatch
2. **Update Metrics**: Python script fetches latest data from GitHub API
3. **Deploy**: GitHub Pages publishes updated dashboard

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# 1. Update metrics
python war-room/api/update-metrics.py

# 2. Commit changes
git add war-room/
git commit -m "chore: update dashboard metrics"
git push

# 3. GitHub Pages will auto-deploy
```

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

### GitHub Actions Permissions

Ensure the workflow uses the minimal permissions needed for GitHub Pages:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

### Customization

Edit `war-room/data/*.json` files to customize:

- **metrics.json** - System-wide performance metrics
- **agent-log.json** - Agent activity feed items
- **repos.json** - Repository list and health scores

## Metrics Explained

| Metric | Description | Target | Current |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **AOR** | % of operations completed autonomously | >= 95% | 92.5% |
| **RSI** | System reliability and self-healing rate | >= 99% | 98.4% |
| **MTTR** | Average time to detect and fix issues | < 4 min | 4.2 min |
| **Active Repos** | Repositories updated in last 30 days | 30+ | 30 |

## Design Philosophy

The War Room Dashboard embodies the **"Autonomous AI Operating System"** vision:

1. **Transparency** - All operations visible in real-time
2. **Autonomy** - Metrics prove self-governing capability
3. **Resilience** - Chaos engineering validates robustness
4. **Beauty** - Premium design reflects premium technology
